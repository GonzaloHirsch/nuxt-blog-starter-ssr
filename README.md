## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Simulating a Production Server

You can simulate a production deployment by building the server and running it locally:

```bash
npm run build && node .output/server/index.mjs
```

You will find the server on `http://localhost:3000`.

##Â Docker Image

You can run the Docker image locally to test the production server by doing the following (being in the root of the repository):

```bash
docker build . -t ssrblog
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 ssrblog
```

You can visualize the application in `http://localhost:3000`, and if you inspect the network requests, you should see requests for each of the documents once you travel to specific URLs.
